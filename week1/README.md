# Day 1: run models locally with Ollama, write code to call OpenAI's frontier models, distinguish between system and user prompt, summarization 
# Day 2: know building blocks to get to LLM mastery


# Closed Source Frontier: 
- GPT from OpenAI
- Claude from Anthropic
- Gemini from Google
- Grok from x.ai

# Open Source: 
  - Llama from Meta
  - Mixtral from Mistral
  - Qwen from Alibaba Cloud
  - Gemma from Google
  - Phi from Microsoft
  - DeepSeek from DeepSeek AI
  - GPT-OSS from OpenAI 
# 3 ways to use models:
- Chat interfaces: ChatGPT
- Cloud APIS: LLM API, Frameworks like LangChain, Managed AI cloud services (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex, Azure ML)
- Direct Interface: with HuggingFace Transformers library, with Ollama to run locally 

# LLMs come in 3 flavors:
- Base: better for fine-tuning to learn a new skill
- Chat/Instruct: Better for interactive use bases and creative content generation
- Reasoning/Thiking
